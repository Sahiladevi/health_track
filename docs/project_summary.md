## 1. Introduction

In recent years, I’ve noticed how chronic health issues like obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease are becoming more common among adults in the U.S. While we’ve made progress in medical treatments, the everyday causes things like poor diet, not enough physical activity or sleep, and even social challenges, still don’t get the attention they deserve. In this project, I wanted to explore how all these lifestyle and social factors come together to influence our health. To do that, I used the most recent national data from NHANES (2021–2023) and the USDA’s Food Patterns Equivalents Database.

## 2. Project Overview

For this project, I focused on understanding how everyday health habits and social factors like income, education, and access to health insurance are connected to chronic conditions in U.S. adults. By combining data from NHANES and the USDA’s dietary database, I looked at how things like what we eat, how much we sleep, how active we are, and whether we can get the care we need, affect our chances of developing issues like obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. I also wanted to see how these patterns differ based on gender and race or ethnicity, with the hope of helping guide more fair and effective public health solutions.

## 3. What was the question I wanted to answer?

I wanted to understand how people's daily habits like what they eat, how much they sleep or exercise and their background like income or education are connected to their overall health. The idea was to see if certain lifestyle patterns or social factors are linked to better or worse health across the U.S.

## 4. What did I find?

The analysis showed that health is influenced by more than just one factor, it’s a mix of things working together. Here are a few key insights:

People with higher incomes and more education tend to have healthier lifestyles overall. They eat better, are more active, and sleep more regularly.

A healthier diet, measured using something called the Healthy Eating Index, is clearly linked to lower rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart issues.

Physical activity and sleep both matter a lot too. People who exercise more and sleep well are generally healthier, regardless of their income level.

There are clear differences in health habits and outcomes between different gender and racial groups. These gaps suggest that health isn't just about personal choices, but also about access, opportunities, and long-term social patterns.

When you combine multiple factors like poor diet, low activity, and lower income, the risk of poor health grows significantly.

## 5. What might have affected the results?

There were a few challenges that could influence the findings:

The data came from national surveys, and not everyone answered every question. That means we had to work with some missing pieces.

The way the survey was designed gave more weight to certain groups (like older adults), so I had to adjust for that to make sure results reflected the whole U.S. population.

Some of the tools I used didn’t fully support the survey's complex design. So, instead of using the most advanced statistical methods, I used a solid and commonly accepted workaround that still gave reliable insights, but it's not perfect.

## 7. Key Takeaway

Our health isn’t just about personal choices, it’s shaped by our circumstances, environment, and habits working together.

Understanding these connections helps us see where change is needed to improve health for everyone.
