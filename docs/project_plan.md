## Project Title
**Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle, Socioeconomic Status, and Healthcare Access on Chronic Health Conditions Among U.S. Adults: Insights from NHANES 2021–2023**

---

## Project Overview
- Analyze nationally representative NHANES 2021–2023 data.
- Investigate how lifestyle habits, socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, and prescription medication use influence health outcomes.
- Key clinical health measures:
  - Body mass index (BMI)
  - Blood pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Blood sugar
  - Chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension)
- Assess relationships with:
  - Lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sleep, diet)
  - Socioeconomic indicators (income, education, race/ethnicity)
  - Healthcare factors (insurance, medication use)
- Explore variation by gender and racial/ethnic groups.
- Use survey-weighted statistical methods for valid population-level inference.
- Aim to identify vulnerable populations and inform public health strategies.

---

## Purpose
- Examine influence of lifestyle, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors on U.S. adult health outcomes.
- Use NHANES 2021–2023 data for analysis.
- Investigate disparities in health and healthcare access by gender and race/ethnicity.
- Support strategies to reduce health disparities and promote equity.

---

## Scope and Analysis Plan
- Integrate NHANES datasets: demographics, socioeconomic, lifestyle, healthcare access, clinical measures.
- Key variables: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income-to-poverty ratio, physical activity, sleep, diet, insurance, medication, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, chronic disease status.
- Perform survey-weighted regression and interaction analyses.
- Analyze combined effects of behaviors on health indicators.
- Use Python, SQLite, and statistical libraries for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

## Objectives

### Goal 1: Investigate lifestyle and socioeconomic influences
- Characterize distributions of lifestyle behaviors, socioeconomic factors, and insurance coverage.
- Quantify associations with BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and chronic diseases.
- Explore specific relationships (e.g., sleep duration impact on BMI).
- Assess combined effects of diet and physical activity.

### Goal 2: Identify health disparities by gender and race/ethnicity
- Compare distributions across demographic groups.
- Evaluate effect modification by gender and race/ethnicity.
- Develop recommendations for targeted public health interventions.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                              | Mitigation                                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing/incomplete data           | Early data checks, imputation, sensitivity analysis            |
| Complexity of survey design       | Use proper survey-weighted methods, consult NHANES guidelines  |
| High dimensionality and merging   | Use participant IDs, select relevant variables, modular scripts|
| Ethical and privacy concerns      | Ethical language, state limitations, focus on equity           |
| Dashboard performance             | Optimize data, paginate/filter before rendering                |
| Lack of domain expertise          | Use NHANES docs, consult experts, clear caveats                |
| Unclear stakeholder needs         | Define personas early, get early feedback                      |
| Time constraints                 | Prioritize tasks, use version control, treat ML as optional    |
