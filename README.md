# üß™ Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle, Socioeconomic Status, and Healthcare Access on Chronic Health Conditions Among U.S. Adults

## üìä NHANES 2021‚Äì2023 Data Analysis Project - health_track

---

## üéØ Project Objective

This project investigates how **lifestyle behaviors**, **socioeconomic factors**, and **healthcare access** influence chronic health conditions among U.S. adults using the **NHANES 2021‚Äì2023 dataset**. We focus on chronic conditions such as:

- Obesity (BMI)
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- High cholesterol

The key goals are to:

- Understand the role of **diet, physical activity, and sleep** in chronic disease
- Examine how **income, education, and insurance status** affect health
- Identify **gender- and race-based disparities**
- Support **data-driven public health policies**

---

## üìã Project Overview

Using nationally representative NHANES data, this analysis merges demographic, dietary, physical activity, laboratory, and questionnaire data. By applying both traditional statistical and exploratory visualization techniques, we aim to uncover key relationships between risk factors and health outcomes in U.S. adults.

## Data Selection

This project uses a curated subset of variables from the NHANES 2021‚Äì2022 datasets. Only relevant columns were selected from each dataset to support our analysis of BMI, lifestyle, and chronic disease risk factors.

For example:
- From `DEMO_L.XPT`, only demographic, education, income, and weight variables were extracted.
- From `BMX_L.XPT`, only the `BMXBMI` (Body Mass Index) column was used.
- All datasets were merged using the common participant identifier `SEQN`.

See `Data Dictionary` for full list of selected variables and their descriptions.

## üé® Visualizations

- Boxplots and histograms of BMI, glucose, cholesterol
- Grouped bar plots by gender, income, or race
- Scatter plots of calorie intake vs BMI
- Heatmaps of correlation matrices
- Survey-weighted means with confidence intervals

---

## üîç Example Research Questions

1. Do low-income individuals have a higher prevalence of diabetes?
2. Does poor diet (e.g., high saturated fat) increase BMI more significantly in women than men?
3. Are physical activity and sleep protective against hypertension?
4. Is access to healthcare associated with better blood pressure control?

---

## üìà Why Use Survey Weights?

NHANES uses **complex, multistage sampling**, so it's **not valid** to analyze it using raw frequencies. Survey weights correct for:

- Unequal probability of selection
- Oversampling of minorities
- Nonresponse bias

Using weights ensures results generalize to the **entire U.S. population**.
