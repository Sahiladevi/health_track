# Analyzing the Impact of Lifestyle, Socioeconomic Status, and Healthcare Access on Chronic Health Conditions Among U.S. Adults

##  NHANES 2021–2023 Data Analysis Project - health_track

---

##  Project Objective

This project investigates how **lifestyle behaviors**, **socioeconomic factors**, and **healthcare access** influence chronic health conditions among U.S. adults using the **NHANES 2021–2023 dataset**. The focus is on chronic conditions such as:

- Obesity (BMI)
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- High cholesterol

The key goals are to:

- Understand the role of **diet, physical activity, and sleep** in chronic disease
- Examine how **income, education, and insurance status** affect health
- Identify **gender- and race-based disparities**
- Support **data-driven public health policies**

---

##  Project Overview

Using nationally representative NHANES data, this analysis merges demographic, dietary, physical activity, laboratory, and questionnaire data. Traditional statistical methods and exploratory visualization techniques are applied to uncover key relationships between risk factors and health outcomes in U.S. adults.

---

## Features

-  Data ingestion from local NHANES `.XPT` files and conversion to `.CSV`
-  Full data cleaning and merging using **Pandas**
-  Survey-weighted analysis using **statsmodels**
-  Visualizations via **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**
-  SQLite database creation for querying cleaned dataset
-  (Optional) Machine learning clustering and regression
-  (Optional) Streamlit app for interactive visualization

## Data Source

Data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**, a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

- [NHANES 2021–2023](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2021-2023)

## Data Selection

This project uses a curated subset of variables from the NHANES 2021–2023 datasets. Only the relevant columns were selected from each dataset to support the analysis of BMI, lifestyle factors, and chronic disease risk.

For example:
- From `DEMO_L.XPT`, only demographic, education, income, and weight variables were extracted.
- From `BMX_L.XPT`, only the `BMXBMI` (Body Mass Index) column was used.
- All datasets were merged using the common participant identifier `SEQN`.

See `Data Dictionary` for full list of selected variables and their descriptions.

## Visualizations

- Boxplots and histograms of BMI, glucose, cholesterol
- Grouped bar plots by gender, income, or race
- Scatter plots of calorie intake vs BMI
- Heatmaps of correlation matrices
- Survey-weighted means with confidence intervals

---

##  Example Research Questions

1. Do low-income individuals have a higher prevalence of diabetes?
2. Does poor diet (e.g., high saturated fat) increase BMI more significantly in women than men?
3. Are physical activity and sleep protective against hypertension?
4. Is access to healthcare associated with better blood pressure control?

---

## Why Use Survey Weights?

NHANES uses **complex, multistage sampling**, so it's **not valid** to analyze it using raw frequencies. Survey weights correct for:

- Unequal probability of selection
- Oversampling of minorities
- Nonresponse bias

Using weights ensures results generalize to the **entire U.S. population**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
cd project
```

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Requirements

Contents of `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
statsmodels
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

> Only the necessary libraries are included to keep things clean and lightweight. A virtual environment was used to avoid any conflicts and keep the setup isolated from the rest of the system.

---

##  Testing & Validation

- All the code runs smoothly in a clean environment without any errors. 
- The notebooks are well-organized, with clear comments explaining each step. 
- Survey weights were applied correctly during analysis to make sure results are nationally representative. 
- I also tested the SQLite database with a few sample SQL queries to make sure everything was working as expected.
---

##  Version Control

- Tracked using the Git command line interface.
- Minimum 10 commits
- No files were uploaded through the GitHub web interface
- The .gitignore file includes the venv folder.

| **Potential Risk**              | **How I Plan to Handle It**      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Large file sizes**            | If the files are too big to work with easily, I’ll either use a smaller subset of the data or convert them to a lighter format like SQLite. |
| **Missing values**              | I’ll either fill in the missing data (impute) or remove the affected rows, depending on the situation. Whatever I do, I’ll make sure to clearly document the steps in my notebook. |
| **Using weights incorrectly**   | I’ll carefully follow the official NHANES documentation to make sure I’m applying the sample weights properly. |
| **Reproducibility issues**      | I’ll use a virtual environment and include a `requirements.txt` file so that everything can be re-run on another machine without issues. |
