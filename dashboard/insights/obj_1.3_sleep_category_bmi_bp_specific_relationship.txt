### How Sleep Categories Relate to BMI and Blood Pressure – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what I found using sleep categories (Short, Normal, Long) instead of just hours, helping make sense of how different sleep patterns relate to body weight and blood pressure.

I analyzed data from 5,735 U.S. adults to examine whether sleep duration categories are linked to:

***BMI (Body Mass Index)***, ***Systolic Blood Pressure (top number)***, ***Diastolic Blood Pressure (bottom number)***

#### What the Study Shows

People who sleep less than average (Short Sleepers) tend to have higher BMI and slightly higher diastolic BP.

People who sleep more than average (Long Sleepers) tend to have lower diastolic BP, but no change in BMI.

Systolic BP is not meaningfully affected by sleep duration.

**In short:** Short sleep may harm health more than long sleep helps, but overall, sleep category explains very little of the differences in BMI or blood pressure.

#### Chart 1 (Sleep Category vs BMI)

Short Sleepers have a significantly higher BMI than Normal Sleepers (+1.27 points on average).

Long Sleepers have BMI very similar to Normal Sleepers.

Sleep category explains only about 4% of the variation in BMI.

So while Short Sleep shows a real effect, many other factors matter more.

#### Chart 2 (Sleep Category vs Systolic Blood Pressure)

No meaningful differences in systolic BP between Short, Normal, or Long Sleepers.

Sleep category explains only 0.2% of the variation in systolic pressure.

Age, sex, and race had much stronger effects on systolic BP than sleep.

#### Chart 3 (Sleep Category vs Diastolic Blood Pressure)

Long Sleepers have slightly lower diastolic BP than Normal Sleepers (−1.03 mmHg).

Short Sleepers have slightly higher diastolic BP than Normal Sleepers (+1.25 mmHg), but this result was only borderline significant.

Sleep explains about 2.6% of the variation in diastolic pressure — more than the other outcomes, but still modest.

#### How Sleep Category Affects Health (Compared to Normal Sleepers)

This summary shows the average differences for Short and Long Sleepers compared to people with Normal Sleep:

| Health Measure                   | Short Sleepers vs Normal | Long Sleepers vs Normal | Is It Statistically Real?        |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Body Weight (BMI)               | +1.27 points higher       | About the same           |  Yes (for Short Sleep)         |
| Top Blood Pressure (Systolic)   | No difference             | No difference            |  No                            |
| Bottom Blood Pressure (Diastolic) | +1.25 points higher       | −1.03 points lower        |  Yes (for Long Sleep)          |


#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Short Sleep is linked to higher BMI and possibly higher diastolic BP.

Long Sleep is linked to lower diastolic BP.

Systolic BP doesn’t appear to be affected by sleep category.

##### What needs more attention:

The effects are statistically significant but small — sleep is only one piece of a larger health puzzle.

Other factors like diet, exercise, medications, stress, and age are much stronger predictors.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Promote healthy sleep, especially avoiding too little sleep, as part of a broader lifestyle approach.

Combine sleep guidance with strategies that support weight control and heart health, like nutrition and physical activity.

##### What I Measured:

Sleep was grouped into categories: Short (<6 hrs), Normal (6–8 hrs), Long (>8 hrs).

BMI and blood pressure were based on measured clinical data.

I used weighted regression models to adjust for U.S. population characteristics like age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
