### How Income and Gender Affect Obesity Risk - Weighted (Population-Adjusted)

This summary is based on weighted data, which means it’s adjusted to reflect the adult population across the U.S. so the results give a more accurate picture.

I looked at how income levels (measured by something called PIR: Poverty-Income Ratio) and gender are linked to a person’s chances of being obese.

I used data from around 5,970 adults for this analysis.

#### What the Data Tells Me

Lower income is linked to a higher chance of obesity. As income goes up, the risk tends to go down.

This pattern is much stronger for women.

Women with lower income had the highest predicted risk of obesity.

Their risk dropped a lot as income increased.

For men, the risk of obesity didn’t change much across income levels — it stayed pretty steady.

At the highest income levels, men actually had a slightly higher risk of obesity than women.

So overall, income plays a big role, but it affects men and women differently.

#### Plot 1: Obesity Risk by Income and Gender (Line Plot)

For women, the line slopes downward — this shows that higher income is linked to lower obesity risk.

For men, the line is much flatter — their obesity risk doesn’t shift much with income.

At the very top income level, the lines cross — men end up with a slightly higher predicted risk than women.

#### Plot 2: Obesity Risk by Income and Gender (Bar Chart)

This chart shows a side-by-side view of men and women at each income level:

In the lowest income group, women had noticeably higher obesity risk than men.

In the middle income categories, the pattern was similar — women’s risk was still higher.

At the highest income level, the pattern flipped — men’s obesity risk became slightly higher than women’s.

#### What I Take Away from This

##### What’s encouraging:

Higher income is linked to lower obesity risk, especially for women.

It’s clear that gender and income interact in meaningful ways when it comes to health.

##### What’s concerning:

Low-income women are at the greatest risk — they may face more barriers when it comes to healthy food, physical activity, and health care.

Men’s risk staying steady means other factors could be influencing their weight, outside of income.

##### What I’d focus on next:

Make sure low-income women have better access to things that support a healthy lifestyle — like safe spaces to be active, affordable nutritious food, and health care.

Look more closely at what affects men’s obesity risk, and create programs tailored to their needs.
