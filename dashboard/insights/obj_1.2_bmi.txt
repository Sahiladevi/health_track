### How Lifestyle, Demographics & Sleep Relate to BMI – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

I looked at national health data from over 3,500 U.S. adults to see what kinds of things are linked to body weight, measured as BMI (Body Mass Index). I focused on things like how active people are, how much they sleep, what their eating habits are like, and background factors like race, education, income, and age.

#### What I Found

People who sleep more, are more active, or eat healthier tend to have slightly lower BMI.

People with less education or who are less active tend to have higher BMI.

Some racial/ethnic groups also showed clear differences. For example, Non-Hispanic Asians had much lower BMI compared to others.

But even with all these factors combined, they only explain a small part of why people have different body weights. Most of the difference is due to other things not measured here, like genetics, detailed diet, stress, or medications.

#### What the Charts Show

**Chart 1 (Regression Coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals"): What Each Factor Does to BMI**

This chart shows which things are linked to higher or lower BMI, after taking everything else into account.

Being less active or sleeping less is linked to higher BMI.

Having a college degree, eating better, or being Non-Hispanic Asian is linked to lower BMI.

**Chart 2 (Histogram of Residuals): How Well the Model Fits**

This shows how close my predictions were to real BMI numbers.

It did okay for most people, but didn’t work as well for those with very high or very low BMI.

**Chart 3: Predicted vs Real BMI**

Each dot is a person. The red line shows perfect prediction.

You can see the model doesn't perfectly predict BMI, but it gives a general idea.

**Chart 4 (Variable Importance (Absolute Coefficient)): Which Factors Matter Most**

The biggest influences were:

- Race/ethnicity

- Physical activity

- Education

- Eating habits

- Sleep

**Chart 5: Sleep and BMI**

People who sleep more tend to have slightly lower BMI.

For each extra hour of sleep, BMI goes down by about 0.27 points.

But the effect is very small — sleep isn’t a magic fix.

#### The Big Picture

##### What’s clear:

Lifestyle matters, things like sleep, activity, and diet do have an effect on body weight.

But they only explain a small part of the story.

##### What this means:

Getting more sleep and being more active can help, but they won’t make a big difference on their own.

To improve weight and health, people need to focus on many things together — sleep, food, exercise, stress, and more.

##### What I suggest:

Encourage good sleep and healthy habits, but don’t expect them to work alone.

Support people in making balanced, long-term lifestyle changes — not just quick fixes.

##### How I Did It

I used real health data, adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population.

I ran a type of model that looks at how different factors are connected to BMI.

All measurements (like BMI and blood pressure) were based on real health exams, not self-reported.
