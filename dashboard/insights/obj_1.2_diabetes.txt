### How Lifestyle and Background Affect Diabetes Risk – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population. It shows what I found when analyzing how background and lifestyle factors — like sleep, diet, income, education, and race — relate to whether someone has been diagnosed with diabetes.

I used data from 3,426 U.S. adults to explore how diabetes risk relates to:

**Sleep, diet quality, age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, activity level, and insurance status**

#### What the Study Shows

Some groups had much higher or lower odds of diabetes, especially depending on race/ethnicity, education, and physical activity.

Lifestyle factors like diet and exercise mattered — but background and access to care had just as much or more impact.

**One surprise:** people with health insurance had twice the odds of having a diabetes diagnosis — likely because they’re more likely to be tested.

**In short:** Diabetes risk is shaped by both who you are and how you live — but it’s also about who has access to healthcare.

#### Chart 1 (Odds of Diabetes: Who's at Higher or Lower Risk?)

This chart shows how each factor affects the odds of having diabetes, after adjusting for everything else.

Here’s what stood out:

**Groups with lower diabetes risk:**

- Non-Hispanic White adults had 64% lower odds of diabetes compared to Mexican Americans.

- College graduates had 57% lower odds than people with 9–11th grade education.

- Non-Hispanic Asian adults had 47% lower odds.

- Other/Multi-racial adults and people with some college also had significantly lower risk.

- A higher-quality diet (HEI score), higher income, and being "highly active" were all linked to lower diabetes risk — though modestly.

**Groups with higher diabetes risk:**

- People who had health insurance were 2× more likely to have diabetes — likely because they’re more likely to be screened.

- People who were low active had 72% higher odds, and moderately active had 32% higher odds than those who were highly active.

- Men had a 70% higher risk than women.

- Older adults and those sleeping more also showed slightly higher risk.

- People with less than 9th-grade education had an 18% higher risk.

#### What I Take Away from This

##### What’s clear:

Education, race/ethnicity, and physical activity play a strong role in diabetes risk.

Non-Hispanic White and Asian adults have much lower odds than Mexican Americans.

People with higher education and income levels are at lower risk.

Being physically active is consistently protective.

##### What raises questions:

Health insurance is associated with higher diagnosed diabetes — which may mean access to care = more detection.

Sleep duration showed a small increase in risk — possibly reflecting other underlying issues like stress or health problems.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Improve access to diabetes screening and education, especially for those without insurance or with lower education.

Promote physical activity, especially for people in the low or moderately active groups.

**Remember:** Health equity matters — risk isn’t just about choices, it’s also about environment and opportunity.

##### What I Measured:

Diabetes diagnosis came from medical records or self-reported confirmation.

Lifestyle and demographic factors came from survey responses.

I used a weighted logistic regression model to reflect national-level trends and adjust for many overlapping influences.

This helps us see which groups are most at risk — and where we can focus efforts to prevent or manage diabetes more effectively.
