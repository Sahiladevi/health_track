### Diet and Gender Influence on Total Cholesterol – Weighted (Population-Adjusted)

This summary is based on weighted results, adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what the model found and what the plots show, giving a fuller picture of how diet quality and gender relate to cholesterol levels.

Used data from 4,394 adults to study how HEI diet scores and gender interact to influence total cholesterol levels.

#### What the Weighted Model Tells Me

On average, men have lower total cholesterol than women.

The overall effect of diet quality (HEI score) on cholesterol is very small and not statistically significant.

There’s no meaningful interaction between diet and gender — meaning that better diets didn’t impact men’s or women’s cholesterol differently.

**In short: gender matters more than diet in this model, but diet doesn’t show a strong or clear effect here.**

#### Plot 1: Predicted Total Cholesterol by Diet Score & Gender

The lines go slightly upward, but the slope is very shallow -> suggesting only a tiny increase in cholesterol with higher HEI scores (not expected or meaningful).

The orange line (females) is above the green line (males) -> women have higher predicted cholesterol at all diet levels.

The gap stays constant, showing no strong interaction.

#### Plot 2: Scatter with Fit Lines and 95% CI

Shows a cloud of points with a lot of variability in cholesterol levels.

The trend lines for men and women are nearly flat -> very weak relationship between diet and cholesterol for both.

Confidence bands overlap and stay narrow -> adds to the finding that gender has a consistent effect, but diet score doesn’t shift outcomes much.

#### Overall Takeaway

##### What’s going well:

The model clearly shows that men have lower cholesterol than women on average.

Results are stable across different levels of diet score.

##### What needs work:

Diet quality (as measured by HEI) doesn’t appear to have a strong link to cholesterol in this analysis.

Other factors (like genetics, medications, or saturated fat intake) might play a bigger role than overall HEI diet score.

##### What to focus on:

Consider looking beyond overall diet score — maybe focus on specific nutrients or food patterns that directly affect cholesterol (e.g., fiber, saturated fats).

Keep gender differences in mind when designing cholesterol-related health messaging.
