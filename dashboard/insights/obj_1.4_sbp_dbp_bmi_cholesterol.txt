### How Diet and Physical Activity Affect BMI, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol – Adjusted for U.S. Population(Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population. It explains what I found in my analysis and what the charts show, helping make sense of how diet quality and physical activity levels affect important health outcomes: body weight (BMI), blood pressure, and cholesterol.

I used data from 3,232 U.S. adults to explore how **diet quality (good, needs improvement, or poor)** and **physical activity levels (active, moderately active, low active)** work together to influence health.

#### What the Study Shows

BMI is clearly affected by diet — people with poor diets have much higher body weight than those with good diets.

Moderate physical activity helps offset poor diet, lowering BMI in people whose diet otherwise puts them at risk.

Systolic blood pressure and cholesterol were less strongly linked to diet or activity in this analysis, though the patterns suggest that healthier habits may still help.

The combination of a poor diet and low physical activity leads to the worst health outcomes, especially higher BMI.

#### Chart 1a: Predicted BMI by Diet and Activity Level

The highest BMI levels are seen in people with a poor diet and low physical activity.

People with a good diet have lower BMI — but physical activity still makes a difference even with a healthy diet.

Among those with “Needs Improvement” diets, people who were moderately active had a much lower BMI than those who weren’t active — showing that activity can help make up for a not-perfect diet.

**In short: diet matters, and activity helps a lot — especially when diet isn’t ideal.**

#### Table of Predicted BMI (Body Mass Index)

| Diet Quality        | Active | Moderately Active | Low Active |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Good                | 24.6   | 26.8              | 27.1       |
| Needs Improvement   | 27.9   | 25.4              | 29.0       |
| Poor                | 28.5   | 27.4              | 31.2       |

***Note: Lower BMI is healthier. A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight.***

#### Chart 1b :Predicted Systolic Blood Pressure by Diet and Activity Level

No strong pattern was found between diet or activity and blood pressure in this analysis.

Even people with poor diets or low activity didn’t show significantly higher average systolic blood pressure.

This may mean other factors like age, medication, or stress play a bigger role.

#### Chart 1c:  Predicted Total Cholesterol by Diet and Activity Level

Like blood pressure, cholesterol levels didn’t change much based on diet or activity level in this dataset.

However, there was a small pattern where people with poor diets and moderate activity had slightly higher cholesterol — possibly due to other underlying health issues.

#### Chart 2: Combined Interaction Effects on Health Indicators (Weighted Means) tell us

The chart shows average levels for BMI, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, and Cholesterol across all 9 combinations of diet quality and activity level:

***BMI (Green bars)***

- Lowest BMI: Good diet + Highly active (24.6)

- Highest BMI: Poor diet + Low active (31.2)

- Moderate activity helped a lot—even among people whose diets “Need Improvement.”

***Systolic Blood Pressure (Orange bars)***

- Fairly consistent across groups, ranging from 119 to 127.

- Slightly higher BP was seen in those with a Good diet but Low activity — likely due to other factors.

***Diastolic Blood Pressure (Blue bars)***

- Also steady across groups, generally ranging from 71 to 75.

- Highest readings again appear in Poor diet + Low active group.

***Cholesterol (Pink bars)***

- Levels were high across the board (175–193).

- Highest cholesterol was seen in the Poor diet + Low active and Poor + Low active groups.

- People with good or improving diets and higher activity had slightly lower cholesterol.

Simply,I can say that this combined chart shows the average BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and cholesterol across all 9 combinations of diet and activity. Here's what it tells us:

- Best overall health was seen in people with a good diet and high activity.

- Worst outcomes were in people with a poor diet and low activity.

- Being even moderately active helped — especially for people with diets that weren’t ideal.

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Poor diet is strongly linked to higher body weight.

Moderate physical activity can reduce BMI even if the diet isn’t great.

##### What needs more attention:

Physical activity has a powerful protective effect, especially for people with suboptimal diets.

Blood pressure and cholesterol may be influenced by other medical or genetic factors beyond lifestyle alone — more research is needed here.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Encourage healthy eating as a first-line way to reduce weight-related health risks.

Promote regular physical activity, especially for people with room to improve their diet — it can make a big difference.

Don’t just look at one health habit — the combination of poor diet and inactivity is where the most risk lies.

Look at health holistically—especially since BP and cholesterol may need medical support or further research.

#### What I Measured:

Diet quality came from a national scoring system and was grouped into three categories.

Physical activity was based on estimated weekly energy use.

I focused on three main health indicators: BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

All results were adjusted to represent the U.S. adult population.
