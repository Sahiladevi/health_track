### How Income and Education Affect Cholesterol – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on data adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population, giving a more accurate national picture — not just the study sample.

I analyzed data from 5,498 adults to explore how income (measured using the Poverty Income Ratio, or PIR) and education relate to total cholesterol levels.

#### What the Study Shows

People with college degrees had slightly higher total cholesterol, on average, than those with less education.

Similarly, people in the highest income group showed a small increase in cholesterol compared to lower-income groups.

Overall, income and education explain very little about cholesterol — group differences are small and overlapping.

**A surprising result:** individuals with missing education data had notably lower cholesterol. This likely reflects a data artifact rather than a true health trend.

#### Chart: Average Total Cholesterol by PIR and Education Level

Cholesterol levels are fairly consistent across all income levels — income alone doesn’t appear to make a big difference.

Within each income group, people with college degrees often have slightly higher average cholesterol than those with less education.

However, the differences between education groups are modest, and the error bars (which show uncertainty) overlap widely.

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Higher income and higher education are associated with slightly higher cholesterol — but the differences are small.

Income and education are weak predictors of cholesterol levels.

##### What to keep in mind:

Cholesterol is influenced by many other factors: diet, age, physical activity, medication, genetics, etc.

It’s important not to overinterpret small differences linked to socioeconomic status alone.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Future research should explore lifestyle, clinical risk factors, and access to care — these likely play a much bigger role.

Use this information to avoid assumptions: higher income or more education doesn’t automatically mean better heart health.
