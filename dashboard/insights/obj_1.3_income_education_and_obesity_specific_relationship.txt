### How Income and Education Affect Obesity (Adjusted for U.S. Population - Weighted)

This summary looks at data from nearly 6,000 U.S. adults, adjusted to reflect the whole U.S. population. It explores how income (PIR) and education level are related to obesity — defined here as having a BMI of 30 or higher.

#### What the Data Shows

Education matters a lot when it comes to obesity.

- People with more education are less likely to be obese — and this pattern holds across all income levels.

Income matters too, but not as strongly.

- People with very high incomes tend to have lower obesity rates than others, but the differences are smaller.

The most at-risk group?

- Adults who didn’t finish high school — especially those in the low and high income brackets — have some of the highest obesity probabilities (close to 50%).

- The group with the lowest obesity risk is adults with a college degree, especially those in the very high income group (around 31%).

#### What the Chart Shows

Across all income groups, people with less education are more likely to be obese.

Even among the wealthy, if you didn’t finish high school, your obesity risk is higher than someone with a college degree.

The education effect is stronger and more consistent than the income effect.

#### What This Means

##### What’s clear:

Education plays a big role in obesity risk — more than income does in this dataset.

People with less education tend to have higher obesity rates, regardless of how much money they make.

##### What to keep in mind:

These results show patterns, not causes.

Obesity is affected by a mix of factors: food access, exercise, stress, work, family life, and healthcare access — not just income or school.

##### What we should focus on:

Support people with lower education levels — give them better tools, resources, and environments to make healthy choices.

Avoid assumptions — not all wealthy people are healthy, and not all low-income people are unhealthy.

Education stands out as a stronger predictor in this case.
