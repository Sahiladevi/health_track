### Recommendations for Reducing Health Disparities

In this section, I’m sharing a few recommendations based on what we found earlier. After looking at how health outcomes vary by gender and race, and how different factors interact to shape people’s health, these are some steps we can take to help reduce those gaps and make health more equitable for everyone.

#### 1. Key Findings
Before sharing my recommendations, here’s a quick recap of what I found in the previous sections that helped shape them:

***Body Weight Differences Are Clear***

Non-Hispanic Black women had the highest average BMI, showing a higher obesity risk. On the flip side, Asian adults—both men and women—had the lowest. This pattern was consistent across both the raw data and the weighted analysis.

***Blood Pressure Gaps Are Serious***

Non-Hispanic Black men had the highest blood pressure levels, which puts them at greater risk for heart disease. In contrast, Mexican American women had the lowest readings. These trends were strong and showed up clearly in both weighted and unweighted data.

***Cholesterol Varies by Group***

Asian and White women had higher total cholesterol, while Non-Hispanic Black adults had the lowest. It’s an interesting contrast that may tie into both lifestyle and genetic differences.

***Diet Quality Has Big Gaps***

Asian women scored highest on the HEI diet score, suggesting healthier eating habits. Non-Hispanic Black men had the lowest scores. Overall, women across all groups tended to eat better than men.

***Sleep Patterns Differ Too***

Mexican American women got the most sleep (over 8 hours), while multiracial men had the least (around 7.3 hours). In nearly every group, women slept more than men.

***Income Disparities Persist***

Asian and White adults had higher income ratios (PIR), meaning more financial stability. Non-hispanic black and Mexican American groups had lower PIRs, and within almost every group, men earned more than women.

**Some Health Links Depend on Gender or Race**

Income affects obesity—but more so for women. Low-income women were more likely to be obese than low-income men.

Sleep didn’t strongly predict BMI overall, but racial differences in BMI still showed up regardless of sleep.

Healthier diets didn’t drastically change cholesterol levels in this data,but they did seem to lower diabetes risk, especially for women.

These insights helped me better understand which groups are most affected and where public health efforts should focus. The patterns weren’t random—they consistently showed that race, gender, and income combine to shape people’s health in very real way.

#### 2. Recommendations
So based on everything I found in the data, here’s what I think could really help make a difference—especially for groups who face more health risks because of their race, gender, or income.

***2.1 Make Healthy Living Easier for Everyone***

Support community programs that help people eat better, move more, and sleep well.

Focus on neighborhoods that lack access to parks, gyms, and healthy food options—especially where many Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic families live.

- Invest in safe parks, walking paths, and free or low-cost fitness programs, especially in underserved areas.

overlook sleep.

- Many men across all groups report less sleep.

- Provide simple sleep education, workplace wellness programs, and mental health support, especially in high-stress, low-income communities.

***2.2 Improve Access to Healthcare***

More people—especially in Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic communities—need access to health insurance and regular checkups.

Bring services directly to the people:

- Offer blood pressure checks, diabetes screenings, and preventive care through mobile clinics, schools, churches, or community events.
- Expand affordable coverage, make enrollment easier, and support local outreach in areas with low insurance rates.

***2.3 Talk About Health in Ways That Respect Culture***

Recognize that men and women may respond differently when it comes to things like diet, sleep, or income-related stress.

Build trust—especially with Black men, who in the data had the lowest average diet quality.

- Partner with community leaders, use trusted messengers, and deliver health information in culturally respectful, engaging ways.

***2.4 Tackle the Bigger Picture***

Bring more grocery stores, affordable fruits and veggies, and safe spaces to be active into low-income neighborhoods.

This isn’t just about individual choices—it’s about long-term investments:

- Pass policies that address health gaps linked to race, income, and gender.

- Support schools and workplaces that make it easier to build healthy daily habits like offering healthy meals, fitness breaks, or sleep-friendly environments.

#### 3. Who Needs the Most Support?

Based on everything I found in the data, a few groups clearly face more challenges when it comes to their health and they should be the focus of public health efforts moving forward.

First, Non-Hispanic Black women in lower-income households really stood out. They had the highest BMI levels, which means a higher risk for obesity and related health problems. Diet and income seem to be big contributing factors here.

Then there are Hispanic adults, who had lower rates of health insurance. That means less access to things like checkups and early treatment, which can make a big difference in long-term health.

Non-Hispanic Black men also came up as a group needing more attention. They had the highest blood pressure levels and the poorest diet quality, overall two things that increase risk for heart disease. Add lower sleep and income challenges to that, and it paints a clear picture.

And finally, younger adults from minority backgrounds—especially men were more likely to report low physical activity and not enough sleep. That’s a combination that can seriously affect long-term health if it’s not addressed early.
