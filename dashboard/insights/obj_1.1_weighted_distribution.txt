### Lifestyle and Background Summary – Weighted (Population-Adjusted)

This summary reflects data adjusted to represent the U.S. population using NHANES weights.
It also includes what the plots visually show, so you can connect the numbers with the bigger picture.

Looked at data representing over 188 million U.S. adults (population-adjusted) to understand their health habits, access to care, and daily life. Here’s what we found:

#### Gender

Pretty even split:

- About 51% were women

- About 49% were men

***Chart (Gender Distribution)*** shows this balance visually.

#### Race and Ethnicity

Most of the population is Non-Hispanic White (61%)

Others include:

- Non-Hispanic Black (11%)

- Other Hispanic (10%)

- Mexican American (7%)

- Asian (6%)

- Mixed or other groups (6%)

***Chart (Race/Ethnicity Distribution)*** highlights the diversity across racial and ethnic lines.

#### Education

About 1 in 3 people finished college or more.

Many completed high school or some college.

A smaller group didn’t complete high school.

***Chart (Education Level Distribution)*** shows most adults have some level of higher education.

#### Income (Poverty Income Ratio)

People’s financial situations vary:

- The average person lives at 3x the poverty line

- But there’s a wide range — some are well above, and some are below it

***Bar & Histogram (PIR Summary and Weighted PIR Histogram)*** show that while many are doing okay, a good portion are at lower income levels and could use more support.

#### Health Insurance

Access is strong:

- 91% of people have health insurance

- Only 9% are uninsured

***Chart (Health Insurance Coverage)*** shows most are covered, which is a positive sign.

#### Sleep

Most people get a healthy 7–8 hours of sleep.

Smaller groups sleep too little or too much.

- 79% get normal sleep

- 13% get long sleep

- 8% get short sleep

***Chart (Sleep Duration Category)*** shows most people are on track, sleep-wise.

#### Physical Activity

Activity levels are mixed:

- 52% are low active

- About 24% are moderately active

- The remaining 23% are highly active

The average adult gets about 205 minutes of activity per week, but there’s a lot of variation.

***Bar and Histogram (Physical Activity Mean ± Std, and Distribution)*** show a wide gap between the very active and those not moving much.

#### Diet Quality

This is where things really stand out:

- 82% have a poor diet

- 16% need improvement

- Only 1% eat a truly healthy diet

The average score is just under ***48 out of 100***, meaning most people aren’t meeting nutrition guidelines.

***Charts (Diet Quality Category and Diet Score Summary)*** make it clear this is a widespread issue.

#### Overall Takeaway

Most adults have health insurance

Many get enough sleep

A good number have higher education

A large portion of the population is financially stable

##### What needs work:

Over half don’t exercise enough
