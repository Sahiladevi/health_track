### How Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure Affect Heart Disease Risk – Adjusted for U.S. Population

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what I found in my analysis and what the charts show, helping make sense of how blood sugar and blood pressure affect the chances of having heart disease.

I used data from 4,394 U.S. adults to explore how blood sugar levels (normal, prediabetes, or diabetes) and blood pressure levels work together to affect the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

#### What the Study Shows

People with diabetes have a much higher chance of heart disease, no matter what their blood pressure is.

Higher blood pressure also raises the risk, especially for people with diabetes or prediabetes.

The highest risk is when someone has both diabetes and high blood pressure.

Even people with prediabetes (not yet diabetes) have higher risk if their blood pressure is very high.

**In short: Diabetes makes heart disease more likely and high blood pressure makes it even worse.**

#### Chart 1 (Heart Disease Risk by Blood Pressure and Blood Sugar)

The blue line (diabetes) is always the highest — showing the greatest risk of heart disease.

The green line (normal blood sugar) is lowest across all blood pressure levels.

The orange line (prediabetes) is in the middle — but it rises fast with very high blood pressure.

Even at healthy blood pressure, people with diabetes still had a 25% chance of heart disease.

This tells me that both blood sugar and blood pressure matter a lot.

#### Table of Risk Estimates (Predicted Chance of Heart Disease)

| Blood Pressure Level        | Diabetes | Prediabetes | Normal Sugar |
|----------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Normal                     | 25%      | 9%          | 4%            |
| Elevated                   | 24%      | 8%          | 7%            |
| High (Stage 1)             | 24%      | 7%          | 2%            |
| High (Stage 2)             | 29%      | 11%         | 8%            |
| Emergency High (Crisis)    | —        | 22%         | 6%            |

**Note: No data available for diabetes + emergency high BP in this sample.**

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

People with diabetes and high blood pressure are at the highest risk for heart disease.

Even prediabetes can be risky if blood pressure is also high.

##### What needs more attention:

Many people with prediabetes may not realize they’re at risk — especially if their blood pressure is high.

I couldn’t analyze cases where people had both diabetes and extremely high blood pressure because there weren’t enough of them in this sample.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Help people with both high blood sugar and high blood pressure get early care — they’re at the most risk.

Don’t ignore prediabetes — especially when blood pressure is also elevated.

Encourage healthy habits like eating better, staying active, managing weight, and using medicine if needed to lower the risk.

##### What I Measured:

Blood sugar levels were based on lab test results (normal, prediabetes, diabetes).

Blood pressure followed standard medical categories (normal, elevated, high, and crisis).

I used a model that adjusts for the U.S. population to estimate heart disease risk.
