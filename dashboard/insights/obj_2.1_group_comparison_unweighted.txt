### Health, Diet & Obesity  Across Gender and Ethnicity Summary (not population-adjusted - Unweighted)

This summary shows the results from the actual study sample (not population-adjusted). It also includes what the plots visually show for each category, helping you see both the data and the bigger picture.

Looked at health-related info from over 6,000 people in the study sample to understand their weight, diet, and cholesterol levels across gender and racial/ethnic groups. Here's what we found:

#### BMI (Body Mass Index)

Who had higher body weight:

- Non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American women had the highest average BMI.

- Non-Hispanic Asians (both men and women) had the lowest BMI overall.

***Chart (BMI Distribution by Gender and Race/Ethnicity)*** shows body weight tends to be higher for women in most groups, especially in Black and Hispanic groups.

#### Cholesterol

Who had higher cholesterol:

- White women showed slightly higher cholesterol levels than others.

- Black men and women had slightly lower levels.

But overall, cholesterol didn’t vary a lot across groups.

***Chart (Total Cholesterol by Gender and Race/Ethnicity)*** shows cholesterol is spread out fairly evenly, with wide variation in each group.

#### Diet Quality

How healthy is the food people eat?

Most people had poor-quality diets, regardless of race.

Non-Hispanic Asians had the best scores—more people in that group had “Good” or “Needs Improvement” diets.

***Chart (Diet Category by Race/Ethnicity)*** shows poor diets are common across the board, but Asians stood out with better results.

#### Diet Differences by Gender

Asian men especially stood out with more “Good” diet scores.

Most White and Black women had poor diets.

Men in most other groups didn’t score much better.

***Chart (Diet Quality by Race & Gender)*** highlights these group and gender differences clearly.

#### Obesity Rates

Highest obesity rates were seen in:

- Non-Hispanic Black women – over 52% are obese

- Mexican American and Hispanic women also had high rates

Lowest obesity rates were in:

- Non-Hispanic Asian men and women – only around 16–18%

***Chart (Obesity Rates by Gender and Race/Ethnicity)*** shows big differences in obesity depending on both gender and racial/ethnic group.

#### Additional Stats from the Summary Table

BMI and cholesterol were generally higher in females.

Non-Hispanic Asians had:

- The best diet quality

- The lowest obesity rates

Groups with lower income (like Hispanic and Black participants) also showed worse diet scores and higher obesity.

#### Overall Takeaway

##### What’s going well:

Non-Hispanic Asians show healthier eating and lower body weight.

Some groups have cholesterol levels in a safer range.

##### What needs work:

Most people have poor diets.

Obesity is common, especially among women in certain racial/ethnic groups.

Differences in health often link back to income and access.

##### What to focus on:

Help people make healthier food choices

Target support to groups with higher obesity risk
