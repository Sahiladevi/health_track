### How Lifestyle and Background Affect Cholesterol – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what I found when analyzing how everyday factors like sleep, diet, or income relate to total cholesterol levels in adults.

I looked at 3,285 adults across the U.S. to see whether cholesterol levels are linked to things like:

**Sleep hours, physical activity, diet quality, education, income, race or ethnicity, health insurance, age, and gender**

#### What the Study Shows

Most of these factors had very little effect on cholesterol.

**Two things stood out:**

- Men and Non-Hispanic Black adults tended to have lower cholesterol than others.

- People with higher incomes had slightly higher cholesterol, but the difference was very small.

Overall, all these factors together explained just 3% of why people’s cholesterol levels are different.

**In short: Cholesterol is influenced by many things — and most of them aren’t covered by the lifestyle and background data in this study.**

#### Chart 1 (Predicted vs Real Cholesterol)

This chart shows how close the model’s predictions were to people’s actual cholesterol.

In many cases, it was far off — sometimes by 30 to 50 points or more.

That tells us that cholesterol is hard to predict just from sleep, income, or diet info.

#### Chart 2 (How Wrong Were the Predictions?)

This chart shows how much the model missed by.

Some predictions were close, but many were way off — confirming that lifestyle and background alone don’t explain much about a person’s cholesterol.

#### Chart 3 (What Factors Had the Most Impact?)

This chart shows which things had the biggest effect on cholesterol after adjusting for everything else.

**Here’s what stood out:**

- Men had about 9 points lower cholesterol than women.

- Non-Hispanic Black adults had about 10 points lower cholesterol than others.

- Higher income was linked to slightly higher cholesterol — about 2 points more on average.

- Sleep, diet score, exercise, education, and age didn’t have much of an impact.

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Gender and race had the strongest link to cholesterol in this data.

Men and Non-Hispanic Black adults tended to have slightly lower levels.

##### What needs more attention:

Things we often think of as important — like diet and sleep — didn’t show a strong effect here.

That doesn’t mean they don’t matter — it just means they aren’t the main drivers of cholesterol differences in this study.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Cholesterol is complex. A healthy lifestyle is still very important, but so are things like genetics, medications, and specific foods, which weren’t captured here.

Encourage regular cholesterol checks and combine healthy habits with medical care and individual advice.

##### What I Measured:

Cholesterol was measured using blood test results.

Lifestyle and background info (like sleep and income) came from survey answers.

I used a model that adjusts the data to reflect the full U.S. adult population, so the trends represent the country as a whole.
