### Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors – Weighted (Population-Adjusted)

This summary is based on weighted results, adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what the model found and what the plots show, giving a clear picture of how personal and lifestyle factors relate to systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Used data from 3,500 adults to study how factors like age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, sleep, activity, diet, and income relate to blood pressure levels.

#### What the Weighted Models Tell Me

**Systolic BP (Top Number)** - This is the pressure when your heart beats and pushes blood out.

Men have significantly higher systolic BP than women — about 5.6 units more.

Older age is linked to higher BP — increasing by 0.39 units per year.

People with a college degree have slightly lower systolic BP (around 3.2 units less).

Non-Hispanic Black individuals have notably higher systolic BP (about 6 units more).

Lifestyle factors like sleep, physical activity, diet, and income did not show strong or significant effects on systolic BP.

**Diastolic BP (Bottom Number)** - This is the pressure when your heart rests between beats.

Men again show higher diastolic BP — about 1.85 units more than women.

Less active individuals had slightly higher diastolic BP (~1.36 units).

Non-Hispanic Black individuals had about 4.5 units higher diastolic BP.

More sleep and better diet quality (HEI score) were linked to lower diastolic BP.

Higher income was linked to slightly higher diastolic BP, but the effect was small.

**In short: age, gender, and race show strong links to blood pressure, while sleep and diet have meaningful associations—especially for the bottom number (diastolic BP).**

#### Plot 1: Model Fit – Predicted vs. Actual BP Values

The scatter plots show how well the model predicts real blood pressure.

Residuals (errors) are centered around zero and scattered randomly — this means the model fits the data fairly well.

The fit is stronger for systolic BP (explains ~20% of variation), but weaker for diastolic BP (explains only 4%).

#### Plot 2: Factor Effects on BP with Confidence Intervals

Each dot shows how much a factor changes blood pressure, and the lines show the uncertainty.

If a line crosses the red vertical line at zero, the effect may not be real (not statistically significant).

Factors like gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education clearly stand out for systolic BP.

For diastolic BP, the effects of sleep, diet, and physical activity are more visible.

#### Overall Takeaway

##### What’s going well:

The models show clear, consistent patterns: blood pressure is higher in men, older adults, and Non-Hispanic Black individuals.

**Systolic BP** is well explained by demographic factors.

**Diastolic BP** is more influenced by lifestyle factors like sleep and diet.

##### What needs work:

The model for diastolic BP doesn’t explain much variation — more factors (like stress, medication, or genetics) may need to be considered.

Income and insurance didn’t show strong effects, and physical activity was only weakly linked to BP.

##### What to focus on:

Consider targeting sleep habits and diet quality to help manage diastolic BP.

Address racial and gender disparities in blood pressure through tailored health strategies.

Continue exploring unmeasured factors (like sodium intake, stress, or access to healthcare) that might affect BP, especially for the diastolic measure.
