### How Sleep Affects BMI and Blood Pressure – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. population. It explains what I found in my analysis and what the charts show, helping make sense of how sleep patterns relate to body weight and blood pressure.

I used data from 5,735 U.S. adults to explore whether the number of hours people sleep each night is related to:

***BMI (Body Mass Index)***, ***Systolic Blood Pressure (top number)*** and ***Diastolic Blood Pressure (bottom number)***

#### What the Study Shows

People who sleep more tend to have slightly lower BMI and blood pressure.

However, the size of the effect is very small — sleep alone doesn't explain much of the variation in BMI or blood pressure.

The clearest relationship is between sleep and diastolic blood pressure, but even that effect is weak.

**In short:** More sleep is linked to slightly better health outcomes, but it's only one small piece of a much bigger picture.

#### Chart 1 (Sleep Hours vs BMI)

Shows a small downward slope — BMI tends to go down a little as people sleep more.

On average, each extra hour of sleep is linked to 0.3 points lower BMI.

But sleep only explains 0.3% of BMI differences across people — so many other factors matter more.

More sleep  tends to slightly lower BMI, but the change is minor.

#### Chart 2 (Sleep Hours vs Systolic Blood Pressure)

There's a tiny drop in systolic pressure with more sleep.

Each extra hour of sleep is linked to about 0.4 mmHg lower systolic BP.

Still, the overall pattern is weak — sleep explains just 0.1% of systolic pressure differences.

Slight benefit, but not meaningful on its own.

#### Chart 3 (Sleep Hours vs Diastolic Blood Pressure)

This relationship is a little stronger.

Each extra hour of sleep is linked to 0.6 mmHg lower diastolic BP.

Sleep explains about 0.6% of variation in diastolic pressure.

Most consistent trend in the analysis — but still a very small effect.

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

People who sleep more tend to have slightly lower BMI and blood pressure.

The strongest link is with diastolic blood pressure.

##### What needs more attention:

The effects are statistically real but not practically large — sleep is important, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.

Other factors (like diet, exercise, stress, and medication) are much stronger influences on BMI and blood pressure.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Encourage better sleep as part of a broader healthy lifestyle, but don’t expect sleep alone to drive major changes in weight or blood pressure.

Help people combine good sleep habits with nutrition, physical activity, and regular health checks.

##### What I Measured:

Sleep duration was reported as average hours of sleep per night.

BMI and blood pressure were measured using clinical data.

I used linear regression models adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population and capture general trends.
