### How Lifestyle and Background Affect Blood Sugar (Fasting Glucose) – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population. It shows what I found when analyzing how common factors like sleep, diet, activity, and background relate to fasting blood sugar (glucose levels when you haven't eaten for a while).

I used data from 1,830 U.S. adults to see if blood sugar is linked to things like:

**Sleep, diet quality, age, gender, race or ethnicity, income, education, activity level, and insurance status**

#### What the Study Shows

These factors only explained about 10% of the differences in fasting blood sugar between people.

Some groups had noticeably higher or lower glucose levels on average — especially by gender and race/ethnicity.

Lifestyle choices like sleep, diet, or exercise had much smaller effects than expected.

**In short:** Blood sugar levels are influenced by many things, and most aren't captured by lifestyle or background alone.

#### Chart 1 (Predicted vs Actual Fasting Glucose)

The points are widely scattered, meaning the model often missed the mark.

In some cases, predictions were off by 40–60 points or more.

That shows the model can’t reliably predict blood sugar based on lifestyle and demographics alone.

#### Chart 2 (Residuals Distribution – How Off Were Predictions?)

The tallest bar is near zero, meaning some predictions were close.

But there’s a long tail on the right — some people’s blood sugar was much higher than expected.

That suggests other important factors — like genetics, medications, or undiagnosed conditions — play a big role.

#### Chart 3 (Which Factors Had the Most Impact?)

This chart shows which groups tended to have higher or lower fasting glucose, holding everything else constant.

Here’s what stood out:

- Men had blood sugar levels about 9.5 points higher than women.

- Non-Hispanic Asians, White, Other Hispanic, and Multiracial adults all had lower glucose levels compared to the reference group.

For example:

- Non-Hispanic White adults averaged 17.5 points lower

- Other Hispanic adults were about 16 points lower

- Non-Hispanic Asian adults were 14.4 points lower

Age had a small but steady effect — each year of age added about 0.3 points to blood sugar.

People with higher-quality diets (higher HEI score) had slightly lower glucose, but the effect was small.

Sleep, income, activity, and education showed no strong impact.

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Gender and race had the biggest associations with fasting blood sugar.

Men and some ethnic groups (especially Non-Hispanic Whites and Asians) showed clear differences.

##### What needs more attention:

Sleep, activity, and diet don’t explain much on their own.

Blood sugar is complex — other major drivers (like insulin resistance, family history, stress, or medications) weren’t included in this model.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Encourage regular blood sugar screening, especially for older adults and those at risk.

Healthy habits like good nutrition and physical activity still matter — but they aren’t the whole story.

Consider personalized care that looks beyond lifestyle — especially for blood sugar management.

##### What I Measured:

Fasting glucose was measured via blood tests.

Lifestyle and background factors came from survey data.

I used a model adjusted to reflect the U.S. population, so results show national-level patterns — but may still miss individual-level details.
