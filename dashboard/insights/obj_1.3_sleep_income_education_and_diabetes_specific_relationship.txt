### How Income and Education Relate to Diabetes Risk – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national data adjusted to reflect the U.S. adult population. It explains what I found when looking at how income and education levels affect people’s chances of having diabetes.

I analyzed data from 5,983 U.S. adults to see how likely different groups are to have diabetes, depending on:

- Poverty-Income Ratio (PIR) – which shows how much someone earns relative to the poverty line (Low, Mid, High, Very High).

- Education Level – ranging from less than 9th grade to college graduates.

#### What the Study Shows

People with lower income and less education are more likely to have diabetes.

College graduates are far less likely to have diabetes — even when they have low income.

The highest risk is for those who have both low income and low education.

**In short: Education has a strong link to diabetes risk, even more than income in many cases.**

#### Chart: Diabetes Risk by Income and Education

In the Low-income group, people with less than a 9th-grade education had a 23% chance of having diabetes.
But those who were college graduates had just a 10% chance.

This pattern holds across all income levels — more education always lowers the risk.

In the Very High-income group, diabetes risk is much lower overall, but still twice as high for those with low education compared to college grads.

#### How Education Affects Diabetes Risk

This table shows how likely different education levels are to be linked to diabetes, compared to those who only completed 9–11th grade (used as the baseline group):

| Education Level              | Effect on Diabetes Risk | Is It Statistically Real? |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Less than 9th grade         | Slightly higher risk     |  Yes                     |
| High school/GED             | Lower risk               |  Yes                     |
| Some college or AA degree   | Lower risk               |  Yes                     |
| College graduate or above   | Much lower risk          |  Yes                     |


#### How Income Affects Diabetes Risk

This table compares different income levels (PIR) to the "High" income group:

| Income Level (PIR) | Effect on Diabetes Risk | Is It Statistically Real? |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Low                | Higher risk              |    Yes                     |
| Mid                | Slightly higher risk     |    Yes                     |
| Very High          | Lower risk               |    Yes                     |

#### Key Takeaways

##### What’s clear:

Less education and lower income both raise the risk of diabetes.

Education stands out — even people with low income are less likely to have diabetes if they’ve completed college.

The most at-risk group? Those with both low income and low education.

##### What needs more attention:

These patterns suggest that social factors — like education access and financial stability — play a major role in diabetes risk.

Risk isn’t just about personal health choices — it’s also shaped by opportunity, support, and awareness.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Public health efforts should target groups with lower income and education — helping them get better access to health info, screenings, and care.

Education is protective — so empowering people with knowledge can go a long way in reducing diabetes risk.

##### What I Measured:

Income was grouped into categories based on the Poverty-Income Ratio (PIR): Low, Mid, High, Very High.

Education levels ranged from <9th grade up to college graduates.

Diabetes status was based on clinical diagnosis or lab measures.

I used weighted logistic regression to adjust for the U.S. population (age, sex, and race/ethnicity included), so the results reflect national trends.
