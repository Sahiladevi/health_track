### How Lifestyle and Background Affect Cardiovascular Disease Risk – Adjusted for U.S. Population (Weighted)

This summary is based on national health data adjusted to reflect the adult U.S. population. It explores how lifestyle and background — including diet, sleep, income, education, race/ethnicity, and blood sugar, relate to the odds of having cardiovascular disease (CVD).

I used data from 1,727 U.S. adults to examine how CVD risk is linked to:

**Diet, sleep, income, education, age, gender, race/ethnicity, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and physical activity**

#### What the Study Shows

Certain lifestyle and background factors strongly shape heart disease risk.

Poor diet, low income, and low education were some of the biggest drivers of risk — often even more than cholesterol or blood pressure.

**Surprisingly:** Having “normal” blood pressure didn’t reduce risk much. In some cases, it was actually linked to higher odds than mild hypertension.

**Bottom line:** Heart disease risk is shaped by how you live — but also by your environment, access to good food, and socioeconomic opportunity.

#### Chart: Odds of Heart Disease – What Raises or Lowers Risk?

This chart shows how each factor is linked to the odds of cardiovascular disease — after adjusting for everything else.

Here’s what stood out:

**Groups with Lower CVD Risk:**

- Normal blood sugar → 70% lower odds of CVD

- Prediabetes -> Also much lower risk than diabetes

- Very high income

- College degree or higher

- Multi-racial or “Other” ethnicity

**Groups with Higher CVD Risk:**

- Poor diet -> 6× higher odds — the strongest single risk factor

- Diet needs improvement -> Over 5× higher odds

- Less than 9th grade education -> 3.4× higher odds

- Low income -> 3.3× higher odds

- Non-Hispanic White, Black, and Asian adults had higher risk than Mexican Americans

- Men -> Over 2× the odds compared to women

- Short sleep (<6 hours) -> Increased risk

- Overweight or obese -> Higher odds

- Low or moderate physical activity -> Higher risk

- High cholesterol and older age -> Also raised risk

#### What I Take Away from This

##### What’s clear:

Diet quality is the biggest single factor for heart disease — far more than cholesterol or blood pressure alone.

Income and education make a major difference. Poverty and low education dramatically increase risk.

Being physically active and sleeping well seem protective, while short sleep and inactivity increase risk.

##### What raises questions:

“Normal” blood pressure was oddly linked to slightly higher risk than mild hypertension — possibly due to other hidden health issues or medication patterns.

Ethnic differences in risk may reflect access to care, diet, and income — not just biology.

##### What I recommend focusing on:

Invest in diet education and food access, especially for low-income communities.

Support programs for early education, especially targeting cardiovascular risk.

Promote sleep health and physical activity, both of which play a meaningful role.

**Remember:** CVD risk isn’t just about personal habits — it’s also shaped by environment, education, and access to good care and healthy food.

##### What I Measured:

Cardiovascular disease was based on medical records or reported diagnosis.

Lifestyle and demographic data came from national health surveys.

I used a weighted logistic regression model to reflect national patterns and adjust for overlapping factors.

This helps highlight which groups are most at risk — and where we can act to reduce heart disease in the U.S.
